This was my submission for the first homework of my Artificial Intelligence course at university. 

The goal was to solve the river crossing puzzle with a robot, a fox, a chicken and chicken-feed.

It can be solved using 4 different search algorithms: breadth first search, depth first search, iterative deepening depth first search, and depth limited search.
Also, the class can be run with the boat being able to contain either 2 or 3 characters at once.
